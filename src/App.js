// Set up the Redux flow
// User should be able to add features to their car
// User should be able to remove added features from their car
// Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car

// DUSTIN'S PREFERRED FLOW:
// ðŸ‘‰ x Set up "empty" reducer and initial state 
// ðŸ‘‰ x Set up store and Provider 
// ðŸ‘‰ Connect components 
// ðŸ‘‰ Add events and event handlers in UI 
// ðŸ‘‰ Build action creators 
// ðŸ‘‰ write the reducer logic for the actions 
// ðŸ‘‰ Rinse and repeat
